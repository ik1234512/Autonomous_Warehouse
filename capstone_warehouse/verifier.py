verifier.py -- Z3 SMT verifier for the AGV dispatch problem.

Mostly-provided scaffolding for the SMT Reflection Loop lab (see README.md,
Section 4). You should not need to edit anything in this file EXCEPT the
Task 4 stub marked below (`battery_drain_constraint`) and one deliberately
broken constraint you'll find and fix as Task 0 (README.md, Section 5) --
the rest of the assignment is about the ReAct loop around this verifier,
not SMT syntax.

verify_dispatch_smt(raw_payload) validates the payload against
VerificationPayload, then asks Z3 whether every package can be assigned
to some AGV such that:
  1. every package maps to exactly one AGV index in range,
  2. no package is assigned to an AGV below its minimum battery threshold,
  3. no AGV's assigned packages exceed its weight capacity,
  4. (Task 4, TODO below) no AGV's assigned packages drain its battery,
     on top of that AGV's own threshold, below its minimum.

Task 0 (README.md, Section 5): as shipped, one of constraints 1-3 above
does not actually encode the rule its own comment says it does. Read the
whole function before you touch agent.py -- `python verifier.py` runs a
sanity check against the sat/unsat payloads at the bottom of this file;
if its printed output doesn't match Section 4 / Section 6 of the README,
that's Task 0, not a Task 4 concern.

Until Task 4 is implemented, `battery_drain_constraint` is a no-op, so
Test Cases 1 and 2 (which don't use `drain_rate`) are unaffected -- only
Test Case 3 (Section 6) depends on it.

On UNSAT, the diagnostic distinguishes three different causes of
infeasibility (see the elif branches below) so the feedback text handed
back to the LLM is always mathematically entailed by the numbers in
`diagnostics` -- not just a guess at the likely cause. (That only holds
once Task 0's bug is fixed -- a wrong constraint upstream can make the
diagnostic branch below tell a story the numbers don't actually support.)

    expression (already built for you, same one used in the capacity check
    below) representing the total weight assigned to this AGV in the model
    being checked.
